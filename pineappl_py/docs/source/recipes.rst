How can I convolute a given PineAPPL grid with my PDF?
------------------------------------------------------

.. code:: python

    import pineappl
    import lhapdf
    g = pineappl.grid.Grid.read("path/to/grid.pineappl.lz4")
    pdf = lhapdf.mkPDF("YourPDF", 0)
    bins = g.convolute(pdf.xfxQ2, pdf.xfxQ2, pdf.alphasQ2)

If the grid is actually an FkTable just replace

.. code:: python

    g = pineappl.fk_table.FKTable.read("path/to/grid.pineappl.lz4")

.. note::

    For the :meth:`pineappl.pineappl.PyGrid.read` function, both ``.pineappl``
    and ``.pineappl.lz4`` extensions are acceptable, as long as they are
    consistent (without ``.lz4`` the grid is assumed not to be compressed, with
    it is assumed compressed).

    This is asymmetric with respect to the
    :meth:`pineappl.pineappl.PyGrid.write` function, in which the function will
    refuse to guess, so another version is provided to write a compressed grid,
    :meth:`pineappl.pineappl.PyGrid.write_lz4`

How can I edit a grid?
----------------------

.. code:: python

    import pineappl
    g = pineappl.grid.Grid.read("path/to/grid.pineappl.lz4")
    # edit the way you prefer
    g = pineappl.grid.Grid.write_lz4("path/to/grid.pineappl.lz4")

You can edit your grid in several ways. A few are listed in this section.

Change normalizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One possible option is to change the normalization related to each bin, or
change even the bins themselves.

.. code:: python

    # each element of `bins` is an object with a left and right limit, and an
    # associated normalization
    limits = [(bin.left, bin.right) for bin in bins]
    normalizations = [bin.norm for bin in bins]
    remapper = pineappl.bin.BinRemapper(normalizations, limits)
    g.set_remapper(remapper)

For more details about :class:`pineappl.bin.BinRemapper` check also the `Rust
documentation
<https://docs.rs/pineappl/latest/pineappl/bin/struct.BinRemapper.html>`_, e.g.
on how to treat multidimensional distributions.

How can I get the bin configurations from a given PineAPPL grid?
----------------------------------------------------------------

.. code:: python

    import pineappl
    g = pineappl.grid.Grid.read("path/to/grid.pineappl.lz4")
    # first get the number of dimensions
    bin_dims = g.bin_dimensions()
    # now you can get each of them
    for bin_dim in range(bin_dims):
        bin_left = g.bin_left(bin_dim)
        bin_right = g.bin_right(bin_dim)
