Welcome to PineAPPL
===================

This is the Python wrapper for the `Rust PineAPPL library <https://nnpdf.github.io/pineappl/>`_.

PineAPPL is a computer library that makes it possible to produce fast-interpolation grids for fitting parton distribution functions (PDFs) including corrections of strong and electroweak origin.

The :doc:`installation` instructions are given :doc:`here <installation>`.

A practical example can be found in the ``example/`` subfolder of the `repository <https://github.com/NNPDF/pineappl/>`_.
The Python wrapper is also used in `yadism <https://nnpdf.github.io/yadism/>`_ and `pineko <https://github.com/NNPDF/pineko/>`_.
We also list some common :doc:`recipes` here.
