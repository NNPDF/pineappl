Welcome to PineAPPL
===================

This is the Python wrapper for the `Rust PineAPPL library <https://nnpdf.github.io/pineappl/>`_
using `PyO3 <https://pyo3.rs>`_.

PineAPPL is a computer library that makes it possible to produce fast-interpolation
grids for fitting parton distribution functions (PDFs) including corrections of
strong and electroweak origin.

The :doc:`installation` instructions are given :doc:`here <installation>` and tutorials
are available :doc:`here <tutorials>`. In addition, some practical examples can be found
in the ``example/`` subfolder of the `repository <https://github.com/NNPDF/pineappl/>`_.

The Python wrapper is also used in `yadism <https://nnpdf.github.io/yadism/>`_ and
`pineko <https://github.com/NNPDF/pineko/>`_.
