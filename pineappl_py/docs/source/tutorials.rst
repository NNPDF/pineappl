Tutorials
=========

The following tutorials provide a brief introduction to some of the
main features of the `PineAPPL` Python API. These tutorials showcase
common use cases of `PineAPPL`, from the convolution of a grid with
a PDF set to compute prediction observables to the editing of its
contents. A (slightly) more advanced tutorial is also covered in
which we implement a very simple and short Monte Carlo program and
produce leading-order (LO) predictions.
