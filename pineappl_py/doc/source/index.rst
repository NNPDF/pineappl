Welcome to PineAPPL
===================

This is the Python wrapper for the `Rust PineAPPL library <https://n3pdf.github.io/pineappl/>`_.

PineAPPL is a computer library that makes it possible to produce fast-interpolation grids for fitting parton distribution functions (PDFs) including corrections of strong and electroweak origin.

A practical example can be found in the ``example/`` subfolder of the `repository <https://github.com/N3PDF/pineappl/blob/master/>`_.
The Python wrapper is also used in :yadism:`\ ` and :pineko:`\ `.
