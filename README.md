# What is PineAPPL?

This repository contains programs, libraries and interfaces to read and write
`PineAPPL` interpolation grids, which store theoretical predictions for
[high-energy collisions] independently from their [PDFs] and the [strong
coupling].

PineAPPL grids are generated by Monte Carlo generators, and the grids in turn
can be convoluted with PDFs to produce tables and plots, such as the following
one:
