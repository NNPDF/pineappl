# CLI reference

## `INPUT`/`OUTPUT`: Grid selection

The parameters `INPUT` selects which file is being read from, and similarly for
subcommands that write grids, `OUTPUT` determines which file is being written
to. The CLI `pineappl` does not care about file suffixes at all, but typically
PineAPPL grids have the file suffix `.pineappl`, and if they are compressed
`.pineappl.lz4`. If you write a grid and choose a file name with an `.lz4`
suffix, `pineappl` will automatically compress the file using an LZ4
compression. If a compressed grid is read by `pineappl` it will automatically
decompress it internally, so that this step does not have to be done by the
user.

## `ORDERS`: Selecting perturbative orders

A few convolutional subcommands accept a parameter `ORDERS` which allows to
select a subset of perturbative orders to be taken into account during the
convolution. This must be a comma separated list of orders, which are of the
form:

- `asNaM`,
- `aMasN`,
- `asN` or
- `aM`,

where `N` must be the exponent of the strong coupling (denoted with `as`) and
`M` must be the exponent of the electroweak coupling (denoted with `a`). For
example, in Drellâ€“Yan lepton-pair production `a2,a2as1` selects the leading
order (`a2`) and the next-to-leading order QCD (`a2as1`).

## `PDFSET`: Specifying PDFs or PDF sets

The parameter `PDFSET` that appears for all convolutional-type subcommands
(`channels`, `convolute`, etc.) must be one of the following strings:

- `setname/member`: In this case `setname` must be a valid [LHAPDF] set name
  and `member` must be the member index. The index `0` denotes the central PDF,
  and if `setname` is a set that supports the computation of PDF uncertainties
  the indices `1` through `n-1` denote the uncertainty members. The value of
  `n` can read off from `lhapdf show setname`. For example, the string
  `CT18NNLO/1` selects the first uncertainty member of
  the NNLO PDF set of CT18. `CT18NNLO/0` selects the central PDF set.
- `setname`: This is a special case of the previous specification, where the
  member with index `0` is selected. For example, the strings `CT18NNLO` and
  `CT18NNLO/0` select the same (central) PDF set.
- `LHAID`: This allows to select PDFs using their [LHAID][LHAPDF], which is an
  integer. Non-central members are typically denoted by adding their index to
  the central LHAID. For example, `14000` would select the same PDF set as
  `CT18NNLO` and `14001` corresponds to `CT18NNLO/1`.

Finally, it is possible to re-label PDF sets by adding `=label` to the
specification. This is particularly helpful when plotting predictions with
multiple PDF sets. For example, `NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_luxqed=NNPDF31luxQED`
instructs to use the the PDF set `NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_luxqed`, but it would be
called `NNPDF31luxQED`.

## `REMAPPING`: Remapping parameter specification

This section specifies the `REMAPPING` parameter of `pineappl remap`.

### Motivation

For performance/simplicity reasons most Monte Carlo generators (and also the
PineAPPL `Grid::fill` method) neither support

1) multi-dimensional distributions nor
2) distributions whose bin sizes are not equally sized

*during generation*. To work around this problem a grid with a one-dimensional
distribution with equally-sized bins can be generated instead, and afterwards
the bins can be 'remapped' to an N-dimensional distribution using the limits
specified with the `REMAPPING` string.

### Reference

The remapping string uses the following special characters to achieve this
(note that some of these characters must be escaped in certain shells):

- `,`: The comma constructs 1-dimensional bin limits (1DBL). For example,
  the 1DBL `0,0.2,0.4,0.6,1` expects the grid to have 4 bins whose bin limits
  will be (0-0.2), (0.2-0.4), (0.4-0.6) and (0.6,1).
- `;`: If higher-dimensional bins are needed, the n-dimensional bin limits
  (NDBL) are constructed from a Cartesian product of 1DBL separated with a
  semicolon. For example, `0,0.5,1;0,1,2` expects the grid to have 4 bins,
  whose 2DBL will be are: (0-0.5;0-1), (0-0.5;1-2), (0.5-1;0-1) and
  (0.5-1;1-2).
- `|`: The previous operators are enough to construct NDBL with
  differently-sized bins, but they can not construct the following bin limits:
  (0-1;0-1), (0-1;1-2), (1-2;0-2), (1-2;2-4), (1-2;4-6); here the 1DBL for the
  second dimension depend on the first dimension and also have a different
  number of bins. For the first two bins the 1DBL is `0,1,2`, but for the last
  three bins the 1DBL are `0,2,4,6`. This can be achieved using the following
  remapping string: `0,1,2;0,1,2|0,2,4,6`. Note that there have to be two 1DBL
  separated by `|`, because the first dimension has two bins. If there are more
  dimensions and/or bins, the number of 1DBL separated by `|` must match this
  number accordingly. An example of this is the following remapping string:
  `0,1,2;-2,0,2;0,1,2|1,2,3|2,3,4|3,4,5|4,5,6|5,6,7`. Here the third dimension
  has 6 1DBL separated by `|` because the first dimension has 2 bins and the
  second dimension has 3 bins.

  If the 1DBL is an empty string, the previous 1DBL is repeated, for example
  `0,1,2;0,1,2;0,1,2||0,2,4` is shorthand for `0,1,2;0,1,2;0,1,2|0,1,2|0,2,4`.
- `:`: The last feature of `|` can combined with `:`, which is used to 'cut'
  out bins from the left and/or right. For example, the remapping string
  `0,1,2;0,1,2,3:2|:1||:1|2:` is a more succinct way of writing the following
  remapping string: `0,1,2;0,1|0,1,2|0,1,2,3|0,1,2|2,3`.

Finally note that the differential cross sections are calculated using the bin
sizes (the product of bin widths of each dimension) given by the remapping
string. The option `--ignore-obs-norm` can be used to remove certain dimensions
from the bin size determination, for example `'0,10,20;0,2,4' --ignore-obs-norm
1` will normalize the bins with a size of `2` because the first dimension (with
index `1`) will be ignored
