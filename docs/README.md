# PineAPPL documentation

A good starting point to learn what PineAPPL and its command-line program
`pineappl` can do is the [tutorial](docs/cli-tutorial.md)!

For the CLI also a partial reference [reference](docs/cli-reference.md) is
available.

## API documentation:

- [C](https://docs.rs/pineappl_capi/latest/pineappl_capi/)
- for Fortran there's no dedicated documentation available, because it's a
  [wrapper](../examples/fortran/pineappl.f90) of the C API
- [Python](https://pineappl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/pineappl/pineappl.html)
- [Rust](https://docs.rs/pineappl/latest/pineappl/)

## Code examples

Another way to learn using the APIs is to have a look/modify the
[examples](../examples/).
